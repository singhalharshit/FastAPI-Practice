"""
CRUD Operations - It stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete Operations
In the terms of API :-

Create (C) - We use POST method
Read (R) - We use GET method
Update (U) - We use PUT/PATCH method
Delete (D) - We use DELETE method

Difference between PUT and PATCH:
- PUT: If you want to modify any thing in API so you have to pass every item in the PUT. Like if you want to change title for any post then one needs to pass a new title with every other parameter required in API
- PATCH: Partially updates the resource. Only the fields provided in the request will be updated, and the rest will remain unchanged.
